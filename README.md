# House-Price-Estimator
Machine Learning House Price Prediction Model 

Model predicts California House Prices from neighbourhood features using the scikit-learn built in California houses dataset.

Early stopping, random seeds and regularizers were implemented as the model kept overfitting and was giving inconsistent values every time it was trained.

Only needs to be trained once with the line at the bottom. Once trained this line can be hashed out.
